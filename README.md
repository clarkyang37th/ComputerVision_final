# ComputerVision_final
This repo is for the final project of computer vision CSCI-GA 2271-001. This project is about construction design recognition, by Minghe Yang and Qiyu Xiao. The raw data for this project can be downloaded through link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsLlTcMUQBHD7TEWskxmgTHyTiEromNr/view?usp=sharing. The dataset has both image files of blueprint scan and corresponding room labels saved in xml files with same names of the image files.\
The code in 1_data_process.ipynb is about cropping and then resize the original image file for better training and save the corresponing room coordinate labels in a Json file with a format that's suitable.\
The code in 2_room_detection.ipynb is about applying Detectron2 to the preprocessed dataset for room detections, namely finding all rooms that exist in an apartment blueprint. It mainly consists of downloading the Detectron2 packages, register the dataset with Detectron2, training and evaluation.\
The code in 3_room_classfication.ipynb is similar to the code in 2_room_detection.ipynb with slight change to make the model not only detect rooms but also try to distinguish 'stairs', 'bedroom' and all rooms with 'other' functionalities.
